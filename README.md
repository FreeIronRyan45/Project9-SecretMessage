Project9-SecretMessage for Javascript Course


So, this is project 9 for Javascript course I'm doing on Codecademy Pro. So since I finished learning about arrays recently for my Javascript course on Codecademy, I'll be transforming a array of strings into a secret message. I can use the Mozilla Developer Network documentation to reference any method with which I'm not familiar. Right click on link to access project.

Here's the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) on arrays I used for project: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array.
